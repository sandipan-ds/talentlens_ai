# Architecture Changelog

## Overview

This document records architecture changes that affect system structure, runtime behavior, AI workflows, storage, APIs, or deployment.

## 2026-06-19 (PM) — Doc alignment sweep (WORKING_LOGIC.md as canonical)

### Added
- `docs/CURRENT_PROGRESS.md` — single status doc mapping every step of `WORKING_LOGIC.md` to ✅ / 🟡 / ⬜.
- `docs/WORKING_LOGIC.md` is now the canonical scoring/evaluation spec (DEC-011). All other docs defer to it for scoring details.

### Changed
- `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` — added JD clarification loop (Green / Yellow / Red), per-item `expected_years`, single canonical scorer, RAG-as-explanation flow.
- `SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md` — Job Service now runs the clarification loop; Scoring Engine is the single canonical scorer; RAG Engine is explanation-only.
- `AI_ARCHITECTURE.md` — §3 (JD processing) now includes the clarification classifier; §5 (Candidate Evaluation) rewritten around the single canonical scorer; legacy triad marked retired.
- `RECRUITER_WORKFLOWS.md` — Workflow 2 now includes Green/Yellow/Red classification; Workflow 3 includes `expected_years`; Workflow 5 includes resume cleaning; Workflow 6 includes the years-proportional scoring rule.
- `EVALUATION.md` — added per-item scoring evaluation metrics (Skill Presence Precision/Recall, Years Detection MAE, Per-item Score Accuracy, Evidence Section Precision, Snippet Faithfulness, Score Reproducibility).
- `PROMPT_LIBRARY.md` — added SCORE-EXPLAIN-001 and CANDIDATE-COMPARE-001 prompt specs; marked RESUME-CHAT-001 as Active.
- `IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md` — added Phase 4.5 (clarification loop + quality tiers + Candidate Intelligence Report); updated Phase 6 to reflect the mostly-built RAG pieces.
- `DECISIONS.md` — added DEC-010 (single canonical scorer) and DEC-011 (WORKING_LOGIC.md is canonical); superseded DEC-008.

### Decision
- **WORKING_LOGIC.md is the canonical scoring/evaluation spec.** All other docs defer to it for scoring details. `CURRENT_PROGRESS.md` is the single status doc.

## 2026-06-19 (PM) — Phase 4 scorer consolidation

### Added
- Single canonical scorer (`src/scoring/graded_scorer.py`) that satisfies `docs/WORKING_LOGIC.md`.
- Per-item scoring rule: `min(importance, candidate_years / expected_years × importance)` with `importance × 0.3` partial credit for mention-only matches.
- Structured-profile search priority: `experience.entries → skills → education.entries → certifications → projects → summary`.
- Summary-years fallback gated on item category (only non-Education / non-Certification items may use it).
- CLI (`scripts/evaluate_one.py`) prints the recruiter-facing report in the exact format from `docs/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` Phase 4.
- Batch CLI (`python -m src.scoring.batch_score`) writes ranked output to `data/scores/graded/<role>_ranked.json`.
- `scripts/compare_scores.py` shows the canonical ranked table + per-candidate top strengths and gaps.

### Removed
- `src/scoring/keyword_scorer.py`
- `src/scoring/semantic_scorer.py`
- `src/scoring/hybrid_scorer.py`
- `src/scoring/evidence.py`
- `src/scoring/evaluate.py` (re-export shim)
- `data/scores/keyword/`, `data/scores/semantic/`, `data/scores/hybrid/`
- `data/scores/BusinessAnalyst_ranked.json` (orphan)
- `tests/unit/test_hybrid_scorer.py`
- `tests/unit/test_semantic_scorer.py`
- `tests/unit/test_scoring.py`

### Changed
- Candidate scoring is no longer a triad of `keyword / semantic / hybrid` modules; those are deprecated and removed. The new `graded_scorer` is the single ranking signal.
- Total normalized to 0-100 using the config's `scale_factor = 100 / max_score`.
- `scripts/compare_two.py` reads from `data/scores/graded/`, surfaces per-item evidence, and accepts `--strategy graded` as the canonical choice (legacy strategy names print a deprecation warning and forward to graded).
- `scripts/demo_scoring.py` shows the canonical per-item breakdown for the top-ranked candidate.

### Decision
- **Single deterministic scorer** — `WORKING_LOGIC.md` is explicit: *"you don't need so many different scoring or ranking systems, just one is enough."* Per-component breakdowns still come from the structured profile, not from running multiple scorers.
- **RAG is reserved for explanations and resume chat** — never for ranking. The scorer itself is deterministic and offline.

## 2026-06-19 (PM) — Phase 5

### Added
- Candidate comparison engine (`scripts/compare_two.py`) for side-by-side recruiter-friendly candidate analysis.
  - Loads scored candidate profiles from `data/processed/<role>/<id>.json`.
  - Retrieves canonical graded scores from `data/scores/graded/<role>_ranked.json`.
  - Generates deterministic "Why A ranked above B" narratives using score deltas and component breakdowns.
  - Displays component-level evidence: matched requirement counts, top strengths by category.
- Integration tests for comparison workflow (`tests/integration/test_candidate_comparison.py`, 6 tests passing).
- Evidence-based ranking explanations (no LLM black-box scoring, LLM reserved for future explanation enhancement).

### Changed
- Comparison output format: side-by-side table with normalized scores, score deltas, component breakdowns.
- Phase 5 completes the candidate ranking & comparison pillar of the end-to-end workflow.

### Decision
- **No LLM in scoring chain (Phase 5)** — Explanations are deterministic and auditable. LLM integration deferred to Phase 6+ for enhanced summaries.
- **Candidate ID resolution** — Script auto-resolves user input (file stem or candidate_id) to internal identifiers by searching scores and profiles.

## 2026-06-19

### Added
- Established modular service-oriented architecture in `SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- Established AI workflow architecture in `AI_ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- Established AI design rationale for chunking, embeddings, vector database, LLM usage, scoring, retrieval, RAG grounding, and evaluation.
- Added required governance docs for decisions, model registry, prompt library, evaluation, recruiter workflows, release notes, troubleshooting, and environment notes.
- Added production package foundation under `src/hireintel_ai/` with application entry points, shared config, schemas, ingestion, JD, resume, scoring, ranking, RAG, LLM, storage, and evaluation modules.
- Added test foundation under `tests/unit/`, `tests/integration/`, and `tests/fixtures/`.

### Changed
- Updated `AGENTS.md` architecture compliance references from missing legacy files to current source-of-truth docs.
- Updated the implementation roadmap to include production code foundation before feature implementation.
- Standardized the public product and production package naming on `HireIntel AI` / `hireintel_ai`.

### Risks
- The workspace folder is still named `talentlens_ai`, but product-facing docs and production package names now use `HireIntel AI` / `hireintel_ai`.
