# Decisions

## Overview

This document records significant product, architecture, AI, data, and implementation decisions.

Every major architecture or AI change must be documented here before implementation, then reflected in the affected source-of-truth documents.

## DEC-006: In-memory numpy vector index (defer Qdrant)

**Date:** 2026-06-19
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** We needed a vector store for ~4k chunks to enable retrieval for both JD matching and semantic scoring. `Qdrant` was previously proposed but introduces a separate service to deploy, monitor, and secure.

**Decision:** Persist chunk vectors to `data/embeddings/index.npz` (compressed numpy). Load on first retrieval. Keep Qdrant as the planned upgrade when scale exceeds single-machine memory or we need hosted multi-user concurrency.

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **Qdrant:** Best long-term option, but operational overhead before we have users.
- **ChromaDB:** Lighter than Qdrant but still a service.
- **FAISS:** Fast but poor metadata filtering.

**Consequences:**
- Zero infra dependencies to run locally / on a single machine.
- 6 MB on disk for 4k chunks × 384 dims; trivial to load.
- Trivial to swap to Qdrant later — `src/rag/index.py.VectorIndex` is the only abstraction to replace.

## DEC-007: MiniLM-L6-v2 as primary embedding model (defer BGE-M3)

**Date:** 2026-06-19
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** BGE-M3 was previously proposed. After scoping the v1 system to English-only JDs and resumes with ~4k chunks, we evaluated latency, cost, and PII constraints.

**Decision:** Use `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (384-dim, ~80 MB, CPU-runnable, no API key) as the active embedding model. Keep BGE-M3 as the planned upgrade path for multilingual candidates.

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **BGE-M3:** Multilingual, larger model.
- **OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small`:** Highest quality, but per-token API cost and PII egress.
- **E5 / Nomic:** Comparable to MiniLM but with weaker English retrieval.

**Consequences:**
- Fully offline, no API key, no candidate data egress — strong PII story.
- One embedding call per (JD bullet × candidate) at scoring time → fast enough for our scale.
- Model swap is isolated to `src/rag/embeddings.DEFAULT_MODEL_NAME`.

## DEC-008: Three scoring strategies (keyword, semantic, hybrid) with `α = 0.5` default

**Date:** 2026-06-19
**Status:** Superseded by DEC-010

**Context:** Keyword-only scoring is fast and auditable but misses synonyms. LLM-direct ranking is prohibited by `AGENTS.md`. We needed a way to add synonym awareness without giving up explainability or reproducibility.

**Decision (original):** Ship three independent scorers, each writing to its own output folder:
- `keyword_scorer.py` — deterministic binary match against recruiter weights.
- `semantic_scorer.py` — JD-bullet cosine vs candidate's chunks (mean × 100).
- `hybrid_scorer.py` — `α × keyword + (1-α) × semantic`, default `α = 0.5`.

**Superseded by DEC-010:** the canonical scorer (`graded_scorer.py`) replaces
the triad. The legacy modules were removed 2026-06-19; the CLI accepts the
legacy strategy names only as deprecated aliases.

## DEC-010: Single canonical deterministic scorer (`graded_scorer.py`)

**Date:** 2026-06-19
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** `WORKING_LOGIC.md` is explicit: *"you don't need so many different scoring or ranking systems, just one is enough."* The legacy keyword / semantic / hybrid triad produced three non-comparable numbers and made recruiter interpretation harder, not easier. We also needed years-proportional scoring (a candidate with 1 year of Power BI should not score the same as one with 6 years), which the binary keyword scorer couldn't express.

**Decision:** Ship one deterministic scorer (`src/scoring/graded_scorer.py`) that operates in **two modes** per `WORKING_LOGIC.md` ("Fundamental Rule"):

1. **Code-only scoring** — for fully measurable requirements (total experience, skill presence + years, degree match, certification match, institute/cert tier lookups). Uses synonym dictionary + structured profile search + regex years detection. Per-item raw score = `min(importance, candidate_years / expected_years × importance)`, with `importance × 0.3` partial credit for mention-only matches. No LLM involved.

2. **Rubric-bound LLM evidence scoring** — for requirements requiring judgment (skill depth, relevant/same-role/leadership experience, project complexity, domain expertise). The LLM receives the full content of the mapped section(s) via Section-Routed Evidence Retrieval (exact label match, not similarity-ranked) and scores against a recruiter-defined rubric. The LLM does not see the weight and never computes the final weighted contribution.

In both modes:
- Weight application and final aggregation are computed in code, never by the LLM.
- Total normalized to 0–100 via `scale_factor = 100 / max_score` from the recruiter config.
- Per-item evidence is recorded: matched section, exact snippet, years detected, recruiter-readable reason.
- Rubric sub-scores and cited evidence are cached at scoring time for fast, consistent score explanations.

The legacy `keyword_scorer.py`, `semantic_scorer.py`, `hybrid_scorer.py` modules were removed. The CLI accepts `--strategy keyword|semantic|hybrid` only as a deprecated alias that prints a `DeprecationWarning` and forwards to `graded`.

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Keep the triad (rejected — spec says one scorer is enough).
- LLM-direct ranking (rejected by `AGENTS.md`).
- ML-trained ranker (deferred — see `AI_DESIGN_RATIONALE.md` §5 future upgrade path).
- Code-only scoring for everything (rejected — skill depth, relevant experience, and project complexity require genuine judgment that synonym+regex cannot provide).

**Consequences:**
- One canonical ranking signal per role; cross-role comparisons are direct.
- Per-item evidence is auditable from the candidate's own words.
- Years-proportional scoring rewards demonstrated depth, not just keyword presence.
- Summary-years fallback only applies to experience-style items, so credentials (BE/BTech, CBAP) aren't contaminated by total tenure.
- Rubric-bound LLM mode ensures judgment-based scoring is anchored to recruiter-defined rubrics, not LLM opinions.

## DEC-011: `WORKING_LOGIC.md` is the canonical scoring/evaluation spec

**Date:** 2026-06-19
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` and `WORKING_LOGIC.md` both describe scoring, but they drifted apart — `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` still referenced the legacy triad while `WORKING_LOGIC.md` was the source of truth for the single-scorer design. Recruiters and contributors reading the docs got conflicting answers.

**Decision:** `WORKING_LOGIC.md` is the canonical spec for scoring, evaluation, and ranking. All other docs (`PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`, `SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `AI_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `RECRUITER_WORKFLOWS.md`, `EVALUATION.md`, etc.) defer to it for scoring details and link to it at the top. `CURRENT_PROGRESS.md` is the status snapshot ("what's done vs planned") mapped to every step of `WORKING_LOGIC.md`.

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Promote `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` to canonical (rejected — `WORKING_LOGIC.md` is more detailed and more recent).
- Merge both into a single doc (rejected — `WORKING_LOGIC.md` is the spec; `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` is the high-level product overview).

**Consequences:**
- One source of truth for scoring rules; no more drift.
- `CURRENT_PROGRESS.md` becomes the single status doc, replacing ad-hoc status notes scattered across the other docs.

## DEC-009: pypdfium2 as primary OCR fallback renderer

**Date:** 2026-06-19
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Image-only PDFs in `data/original/WebDesigning/` failed to extract text via `pdfplumber`. OCR fallback via `pdf2image` requires Poppler to be installed on the host — fragile for local dev.

**Decision:** Use `pypdfium2` (which bundles PDFium) as the primary PDF→image renderer for the OCR fallback. Keep `pdf2image` as a secondary fallback when `pypdfium2` is unavailable.

**Alternatives Considered:**
- `pdf2image` only (requires Poppler install).
- `PyMuPDF` (mupdf-based; similar trade-offs to pdfium but heavier dependency).

**Consequences:**
- Zero host-system dependencies for OCR fallback in most cases.
- Same `pytesseract` text extraction layer regardless of renderer.
- Documented in `src/resume_parsing/ocr.py`.
